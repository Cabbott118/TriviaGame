# TriviaGame

This is a Harry Potter based trivia game. 

To begin, press start. 

The game has 15 questions to be answered, with each question having a possibility of four answers. 
Each question will have its own separate timer, set at 10 seconds.
After choosing an answer, you will be sent to the 'answer' screen, which will show if you chose the correct or incorrect answer. Your correct or incorrect var will be incremented and saved for the entire length of the game. 
Should you run out of time on any given question, you will be prompted with a 'Time's Up!' screen, which will also show the correct answer. 
All three possible outcomes will show a picture relating to the question asked, and a relavent fact about the character, object, or whatever subject the question was asking about. 

After completing the game, you will be sent to the final screen, showing correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions as well as a restart button. 

If you choose to restart, the game will reload and erase all answer choices and randomize the questions again.
